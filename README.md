frieda-monitor
==============

This software powers my custom-made monitoring hardware which allows the monitoring
of servers, software builds and any other "traffic-light" like events.

If you want one, there will be much more capable (and cheaper) units in the future!
Stay tuned for updates, mail me your ideas or get one!


Why do you call it "Frieda"
===========================

First of all, all my projects carry female names.
And Frieda is a shorthand for:

- [Fr]iendly
- [I]nteractive
- [E]mergency
- [D]isplay and
- [A]larm
